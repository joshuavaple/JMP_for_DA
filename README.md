Documentation of my analytics projects using SAS JMP Pro 16
SAS JMP Pro 16 is the tool used for the course Data Analytics Lab at SMU.
In this course, I picked up necessary hands-on knowledge of practical data analytics using a user-friendly and powerful tool.
Key learning concepts and deliverables are summarized below. 
Throughout the course, data cleaning and transformation techniques are applied to prepare the analytical sandbox before analyses are run.
